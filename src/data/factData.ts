InSight's findings shed light on the formation of Mars, Earth, and even rocky exoplanets. The lander was built on the proven design of NASA's Mars Phoenix lander. InSight's robotic arm was over 5 feet 9 inches (1.8 meters) long. It lifted a seismometer and heat flow probe from the deck and placed them on the surface. The camera on the arm provided color 3D views of the landing site, instrument placement, and activities. Sensors measured weather and magnetic field variations.",

Once the rover reached a suitable 'airfield' location, it released Ingenuity to the surface so it could perform a series of test flights over a 30-Martian-day experimental window.
